On the right side of the canvas are the controllers for the tool. With them you can select the stroke color, the fill color,
the width, the height and the thickness of your tool (or figure in the case you selected it)

stroke -  Selects the outside color of the figure (The margin)
fill   -  Selects the inside color of the figure (The filling)
width  -  Gives the width to the figures (Circle and rectangle and the Avocado (Image))
height -  Gives the height to the figures (Circle and rectangle and the Avocado (Image))
thickness - Sets the thickness of the line for the pencil and the line tool.

Avocados can not be downloaded : "Tainted canvases may not be exported."
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20424279/canvas-todataurl-securityerror

"Although you can use images without CORS approval in your canvas, doing so taints the canvas. Once a canvas has been tainted, you can no longer pull data back out of the canvas. For example, you can no longer use the canvas toBlob(), toDataURL(), or getImageData() methods; doing so will throw a security error.
This protects users from having private data exposed by using images to pull information from remote web sites without permission."

----- Matrix Multiplication Tool - Description -----

Matrix multiplication is a operation that produces a matrix from two matrices A and B
in  more detail, if A is an n x m matrix and B is an m x p matrix, their product AB is an n x p matrix in which the m entries across a row of A are multiplied with the m entries down a columns of B and dummed to produce an entry of AB

Matrix Multiplication Tool - Usage:
- default size of Matrices is 3x3
- size of Matrices is changeable
	-> You can change the size of rows and columns with the buttons "Zeile +/-" and "Spalte +/-"
- default values of the matrices are zero matrix
- values of matrices are changeable
	-> You can change the values by clicking into input field of matrix elements and
		(a) writing numbers or
		(b) change values with arrow keys
- by clicking the button "A*B" the matrix multiplication is started

Matrix Multiplication - calculation steps:
Preprocessing:
(1) get values of input matrices A and B
(2) save values in multidimensional array
(3) check if matrix multiplication condition is complied
	- condition: the number of columns of matrix A have to be the same 	as the number of rows of matrix B
(3.1) if condition is complied calculation is started
(3.2) else error message is displayed and calculation is canceled

Calculation:
(4) multiplication Matrix A and B by Falk scheme
(5) save values of resulting Matrix in multidimensional array
(6) set values of result matrix table with values of multidimensional array
